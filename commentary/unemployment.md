Northern Ireland has traditionally had some of the highest unemployment rates across the United Kingdom. Many attribute this to the Troubles, but in fact unemployment in Northern Ireland has been relatively high since the 1920’s following the de-industrial of the region after World War I.

Following the signing of the Belfast Agreement, Northern Ireland has made significant progress in Labour Market Participation statistics. The 2008 Recession had a significant impact as a result of the overheated real estate market and the region’s dependence on house builders and construction companies.

Despite the recovery, Northern Ireland continues to have the worst-performing Labour Market Participation statistics across the UK.
