Northern Ireland housing prices have traditionally been much more affordable than other areas of the United Kingdom and Ireland.

During the early 2000s, Northern Ireland witnessed a house price boom which resulted in prices doubling between 2000 and 2008, despite salaries increasing by only 20%. Following the crash, house prices fell by 50% resulting in a period of recession and the collapse of many property and construction related businesses.

Following the recession, house prices have experienced moderate growth but still lag behind the high points of this previous period.

House price growth has been strongest in the commuter belt to Belfast with towns such as Lisburn, Hillsborough, Ballymena and Bangor enjoying the largest growth. These towns also benefited from the M1 motorway investment from Dublin to Belfast.
