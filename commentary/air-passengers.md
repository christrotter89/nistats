Northern Ireland has two major airports:
Belfast International
Belfast City Airport

Derry City Airport also runs a number of flight.

Northern Ireland airports have struggled to compete against a resurgent Dublin Airport which has invested heavily in new routes and infrastructure. This has been compounded by the 2005 M1 motorway investment which reduced travel times to Dublin from Belfast from 3 hours to 2 hours 15 minutes, making Dublin a more viable alternative for price consious Northern Ireland flyers.

Belfast City Airport also has a restriction on the number of flights that can take off and land as a result of noise pollution for residents living near Belfast Lough.

The Belfast-London route is one of the busiest in the Europe as a result of the significant commercial ties between the two regions.
