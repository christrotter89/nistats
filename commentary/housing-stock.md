Real estate in Northern Ireland has historically been significantly cheaper than housing across other areas of the United Kingdom. This is largely due to lower average earnings.

Even for those on lower salaries, high quality housing tends to be readily available and affordable.

During the 1990s and early 2000s, Northern Ireland witnessed a large expansion in housing units as a result of a real estate boom.

The Eastern counties tend to have a significant number of detached and semi-detached housing estates, which serve as commuter suburbs to Belfast.

Western counties, which are further from Belfast, are more rural and have large numbers of farm houses and smaller urban concentrations.

Residents tend to have a preference for houses rather than apartments, but an increasing number of younger professionals now prefer urban living in apartment blocks which provide convenient access to city centre employers and a vibrant dining and cultural scene in Belfast.
