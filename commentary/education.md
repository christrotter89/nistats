The Northern Ireland education system was historically influenced by the English system, however they have diverged from the 1970’s following the Labour government's decision to halt the introduction of new Grammar schools.

Selection tests in Northern Ireland have typically resulted in children being divided into two streams: grammar school or secondary school. The curriculum of both systems remain relatively aligned, reinforced by both groups being required to complete GCSE tests.

Traditionally both Nationalists and Unionists were strong supporters of selection tests. However, Sinn Fein, who’s political ideology is heavily influenced by socialism, rejected the concept of selection at age eleven and successfully campaigned for the abolishment of the eleven-plus exam as part of the Programme for Government 2008.

With the abolishment of the eleven-plus exam, schools formed organisations to establish and evaluate their own entrance tests.

As a result of the continued entry tests, educational performance differs significantly between secondary schools and grammar schools at both GCSE and A-level.
