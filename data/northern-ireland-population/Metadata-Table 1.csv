Description of Data,,,,
Mid-2015 population estimates were published on 23 June 2016 for Northern Ireland. All estimates take into account the 2011 Census results.,,,,
,,,,
Time Period,,,,
"Estimates are provided for each decade 1821-1901, then yearly to 2015",,,,
,,,,
Details of the information held on this dataset are outlined below:,,,,
,,,,
Methodology,,,,
"The Northern Ireland population estimates are created using the cohort-component method. This method updates the Census estimates by ‘ageing on’ populations and applying information on births, deaths and migration.",,,,
,,,,
Geographic Referencing,,,,
"Population Estimates are based on a large number of secondary datasets. Where the full address was available, the Pointer Address database was used to allocate a unique property reference number (UPRN) and geo-spatial co-ordinates to each home address. These can then be used to map the address to particular geographies. Where it was not possible to assign a unique property reference number to an address using the Pointer database, or where the secundary dataset contained only postcode information, the Central Postcode Directory was used to map home address postcodes to higher geographies. A small proportion of records with unknown geography were apportioned based on the spatial characteristics of known records. ",,,,
